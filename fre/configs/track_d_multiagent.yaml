# Track D: Multi-Agent Coordination Experiment
# Scientific Question: Does collective intelligence emerge from K-Index optimization?

experiment:
  name: "track_d_multiagent"
  n_agents: 5
  episodes: 50
  max_steps: 200

parameters:
  # Communication network topology
  network_topology: "fully_connected"  # Options: fully_connected, ring, star, random
  
  # Communication cost (higher = more expensive to share information)
  communication_cost: 0.1
  
  # Agent capacity (affects observation noise)
  agent_capacity: "medium"  # Options: low, medium, high

# K-Codex tracking
k_codex:
  track_individual_k: true
  track_collective_k: true
  track_communication_efficiency: true

# Expected findings
hypotheses:
  - "Collective K > sum of individual K when communication is optimal"
  - "Higher communication cost reduces collective coherence"
  - "Fully connected topology maximizes collective K"

# Paper target
paper: "Paper 3 - Collective Coherence in Multi-Agent Systems"
