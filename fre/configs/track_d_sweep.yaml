# Track D: Parameter Sweep Configuration
# Tests emergence of collective intelligence under different conditions

experiment:
  name: "track_d_parameter_sweep"
  base_episodes: 30  # Episodes per condition (faster sweep)
  
# Parameter grid to sweep
parameter_sweep:
  communication_costs: [0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5]
  network_topologies: ["fully_connected", "ring", "star", "random"]
  agent_capacities: ["medium"]  # Can expand later
  n_agents: [5]  # Can expand later

# Fixed parameters
fixed:
  max_steps: 200
  obs_dim: 10
  action_dim: 10

# Analysis
track_metrics:
  - collective_k
  - mean_individual_k
  - emergence_ratio  # Collective K / Mean Individual K
  - communication_efficiency
  - coordination_success_rate

# Expected findings
hypotheses:
  - "Collective K > Individual K when communication_cost is optimal (0.05-0.1)"
  - "Fully connected topology maximizes collective K but may be inefficient"
  - "Ring topology may show higher emergence ratio due to local coordination"
  - "Zero communication cost leads to information overload, reducing coherence"

# Output
save_results: true
