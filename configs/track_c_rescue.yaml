# Track C - Bioelectric Rescue Configuration (Tuned Parameters)

# Grid parameters
grid_shape: [16, 16]  # 2D voltage grid
timesteps: 200         # Steps per episode
dt: 0.1                # Time step size

# Bioelectric grid physics (tuned for morphology stability)
diffusion: 0.03        # Voltage diffusion coefficient (reduced from 0.12 - less spreading)
leak: 0.02             # Leak conductance (reduced from 0.08 - slower decay)
alpha: 0.8             # Nonlinear ion channel strength (increased from 0.0 - self-reinforcement)
beta: 8.0              # Ion channel steepness (increased from 1.0 - sharper nonlinearity)

# Rescue parameters
rescue_enabled: true
target_iou: 0.85       # Success threshold (85% morphology match)
initial_boundary_integrity: 0.3  # Start damaged (30% intact)
damage_probability: 0.5           # 50% of pixels randomly damaged

# Target morphology
target_voltage: -70.0  # mV (resting potential)

# Experiment design
num_trials: 10         # Trials per condition (baseline vs rescue)
