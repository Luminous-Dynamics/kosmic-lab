# Agent Components

- `simulation.rs` – (TODO) integrates harmonics computation for local updates.
- `telemetry.rs` – (TODO) emits K-passport equivalents per node.
- `bridge.rs` – (TODO) handles shared history packaging for TE computations.

These components will be compiled to WASM and embedded in the zomes once the Rust scaffolding is fleshed out.
