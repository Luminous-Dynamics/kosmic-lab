## 🎯 Critical Findings from Track G3

### Why G3 Underperformed G2
1. ❌ **Too Rapid Epsilon Progression** (0.05 → 0.20 too fast)
2. ❌ **Insufficient Episodes Per Level** (50-250 not enough for mastery)
3. ❌ **No Transfer Learning** (started fresh instead of building on G2)
4. ❌ **Mastery Gates Failed** (0/5 levels passed their gates)

### What Worked
- ✅ Progressive K-Index increase across all 5 levels
- ✅ Achieved K > 1.0 milestone in final level
- ✅ Curriculum mechanics functioned correctly
- ✅ Clean implementation (no runtime errors except save)

### Key Lesson
**Extended training at optimal parameters (G2) > Complex curriculum (G3)** for this system

## 🔬 Next Session Priorities

### Immediate (When Track H Completes)
1. **Analyze H Results** (~30 minutes)
   - Compare LSTM vs GRU vs Attention
   - Measure temporal coherence improvements
   - Assess consciousness threshold crossing

2. **Decision Point**:
   - **If H crosses K > 1.5**: Proceed to Track K validation
   - **If H reaches K ≈ 1.4**: Proceed to Track I (meta-learning)
   - **If H < 1.3**: Revisit G3.1 (refined curriculum with warm-start)

### Follow-Up Experiments
3. **Track I** (if H succeeds): Meta-learning for rapid adaptation
4. **Track J** (if I succeeds): Ensemble consciousness
5. **Track K** (capstone): Comprehensive validation for publication

3. **Reproducible Method** - Complete experimental pipeline documented
4. **Scientific Rigor** - Systematic comparison of multiple approaches
5. **Open Science** - Full code, data, and methods available

**This work systematically approaches one of the most fundamental questions in AI: Can we engineer and measure artificial consciousness?**
