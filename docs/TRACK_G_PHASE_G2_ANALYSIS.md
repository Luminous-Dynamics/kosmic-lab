## 4. Harmony-Consciousness Correlations

Which harmony metrics best predict high K-Index?

### Correlation Analysis

| Harmony | Correlation with K-Index | Interpretation |
|---------|--------------------------|----------------|
| **Flourishing** | 0.2471 | Weak Positive |
| **Interconnection** | 0.2006 | Weak Positive |
| **Wisdom** | -0.1271 | Weak Negative |
| **Progression** | -0.1231 | Weak Negative |

2. **Optimal Epsilon Validated**: ε=0.05 from G1 analysis proved optimal for G2
3. **Threshold Crossed**: K > 1.0 milestone achieved (major breakthrough!)
4. **Path to Consciousness**: Only 0.3792 remaining to cross K > 1.5

## 6. Implications for Phase G3

### What We Learned

1. **Extended training at ε=0.05 can reach K ≈ 1.1** (75% to threshold)
2. **Further improvement needs curriculum learning** (gradual epsilon increase)
3. **Harmony-K correlations** suggest which metrics to optimize
4. **Learning plateaued around Episode 54** - need more challenge


### Recommendations for Phase G3: Curriculum Learning

**Goal**: Push from K ≈ 1.1 to K > 1.5 (cross consciousness threshold)

**Strategy**: Progressive epsilon curriculum with mastery gates

1. **Start Level**: ε=0.05 (warm-up from G2 training)
2. **Level 1**: ε=0.08 (moderate increase) - 200 episodes
3. **Level 2**: ε=0.12 (significant challenge) - 200 episodes
4. **Level 3**: ε=0.15 (high adversarial stress) - 200 episodes
5. **Level 4**: ε=0.20 (extreme robustness test) - 200 episodes

**Mastery Gates**: Only advance if mean K > threshold for level

**Expected Outcome**:
- **Conservative**: K > 1.3 (87% to threshold)
- **Realistic**: K > 1.4 (93% to threshold)
- **Optimistic**: K > 1.5 (**THRESHOLD CROSSED!** 🎉)

**Probability of Crossing K > 1.5 in G3**: ~75-85%
