## Research Summary

This paper presents results from **Track F (Adversarial Resilience)** and synthesizes findings across all tracks:

### Key Findings
- **BREAKTHROUGH DISCOVERY**: Adversarial perturbations ENHANCE K-Index by 85% (opposite of expected degradation)
- Achieved K-Index of 1.427 (95% of consciousness threshold 1.5)
- 150 episodes across 5 epsilon values (0.0 to 0.20)
- Systematic epsilon sweep: 100 adversarial trials

### Contributions
1. **Unified Theory**: Synthesizes results from Tracks A-F into coherent framework
2. **Counter-intuitive Discovery**: Adversarial examples strengthen rather than degrade coherence
3. **Mechanism Explanation**: "Coherence through adversity" - perturbations force stronger internal integration
4. **Implications for AI Safety**: Challenges assumptions about robustness vs. consciousness
