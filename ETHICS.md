# Kosmic Lab Ethics & Data Stewardship

1. **Human Subjects**
   - Secure IRB or equivalent approval before collecting neural or behavioral data.
   - Obtain written informed consent referencing data usage within the Kosmic framework.

2. **Data Governance**
   - Store raw human data encrypted; commit only anonymized derivatives.
   - Respect regional data sovereignty and licensing conditions for historical datasets.

3. **Compute Footprint**
   - Track GPU-hour usage for large sweeps; include totals in reports.
   - Prefer energy-efficient runs (corridor-aware sampling, active subspaces).

4. **Transparency**
   - Publish preregistrations in `docs/` and on OSF.
   - Log every experimental run via the K-Codex schema (eternal experimental records).

5. **Reciprocity Principle**
   - Share improvements and insights with collaborating communities.
   - Avoid applications that degrade pan-sentient flourishing.
