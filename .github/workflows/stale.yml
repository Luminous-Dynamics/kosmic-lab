# Stale Issue and PR Management
# Automatically marks and closes inactive issues and pull requests
#
# This workflow helps maintain repository health by:
# - Marking issues/PRs as stale after 60 days of inactivity
# - Closing stale items after 7 additional days
# - Exempting certain labels from going stale
#
# Configuration can be adjusted based on project needs
